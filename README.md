# Project made for the Ludum Dare 41
# This was made in 48 hours

WARNING: It actually miss a lot of stuff i wanted to do. This is pretty much a barebone game. This is my first LD and i defenitively scoped out (i did a parser for the dialogues for no reason) and had a long lasting problem that took me almost 4 hours away.

Anyway, let’s talk about the game.

You have one round to conquer the girl (i haven’t got time to include the man :( ) on the other side. You may lose the game by selecting the wrong answer or by taking to much time to answer.

This was made with Godot 3.0
